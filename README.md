# Machine Learning Labs with Python

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of hands-on labs from the **IBM Machine Learning with Python** course on Coursera. Each lab is focused on applying machine learning techniques using **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and real-world **CSV datasets**.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate foundational skills in machine learning, including **regression**, **classification**, and **decision trees**. These labs build core competencies in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.

## Lab Details

### Module 2: Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression**  
  Predicts CO₂ emissions based on engine size using a simple linear model.  
  Techniques: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

- **Multiple Linear Regression**  
  Builds a model with multiple predictors to estimate vehicle emissions.  
  Includes multicollinearity consideration and model accuracy checks.

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Predicts customer churn using a binary classification model.  
  Topics covered: sigmoid function, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC

### Module 3: Classification and Trees

- **Decision Trees**  
  Classifies which drug to prescribe based on patient characteristics.  
  Focus on entropy, Gini index, information gain.

- **Multi-class Classification**  
  Uses obesity data to classify individuals into weight categories.  
  Techniques: `LabelEncoder`, model evaluation with accuracy metrics

- **Regression Trees**  
  Predicts taxi tips using regression tree models.  
  Compares tree depth, overfitting, and pruning strategies.
